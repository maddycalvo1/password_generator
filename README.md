## Description:

I created a webpage that can generate randomized passwords based on a certain criteria that the user selects.

## Features:

The features this application can do are 

* The user can choose a number between 5 to 120 for their password length
* The user then can choose if they want to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and/or special charachters
* The webpage then generates the password based on what the user selected

## Thought Process

I originally was going to use CharCode to create my array for each criteria (type of characters) but I felt to better understand these functions, I needed to write out each character for the array.

* var lowerCase = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"];
var upperCase = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z"];
var number = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
var symbols = ["!","@","#","$","%","^","&","*","(",")","{","}","[","]","<",">","."];
